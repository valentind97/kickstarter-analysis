# kickstarter-analysis
## performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
### The purpose of this project is to breakdown and uncover trends from kickstarter data and provide useful and relevant information for Louise. The data is filtered to show the outcomes for theater campaigns which are relevant to louise's play and compare how many reached the goal for fundrasing compared to the date. 
## One of the challenges I faced during this analysis of this data was creating the line chart for the outcomes vs. goals . the part I struggled with was creating the data for the number of succesful for the range of goal. writing the proper syntax and havin to change the function for every different range took me a while to understand.Another challenge was having so much data made it difficult to comapre to see if your output values were giving correct values that matched the data you were looking for. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One thing we can conclude for the data of launch date vs outcomes is that the plays tend to reach there goals more frequently in the second quarter of the year. Then they begin to drop down when they reach the winter. Kickstarter campaigns seem to less likely reach there goal during the winter. SO we can make the conclusion that the best time for louise to try and create a new kickstarter is in May as seen in the chart (
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the data we analyzed for the outcomes based on goals we can see that at certain points the percentage of achieving the goal was higher specifically in the points at 45000 and 25000 as you can see in the chart (https://github.com/valentind97/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_goals.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
