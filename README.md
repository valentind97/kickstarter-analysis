# kickstarter-analysis
## Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
### The purpose of this project is to breakdown and uncover trends from kickstarter data and provide useful and relevant information for Louise. The data is filtered to show the outcomes for theater campaigns which are relevant to louise's play and compare how many reached the goal for fundrasing compared to the date. 
## One of the challenges I faced during this analysis of this data was creating the line chart for the outcomes vs. goals . the part I struggled with was creating the data for the number of succesful for the range of goal. writing the proper syntax and havin to change the function for every different range took me a while to understand.Another challenge was having so much data made it difficult to comapre to see if your output values were giving correct values that matched the data you were looking for. 

### One thing we can conclude for the data of launch date vs outcomes is that the plays tend to reach there goals more frequently in the second quarter of the year. Then they begin to drop down when they reach the winter. Kickstarter campaigns seem to less likely reach there goal during the winter. SO we can make the conclusion that the best time for louise to try and create a new kickstarter is in May as seen in the chart (https://github.com/valentind97/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_outcomes_vs_launch.png)

 

### From the data we analyzed for the outcomes based on goals we can see that at certain points the percentage of achieving the goal was higher specifically in the points at 45000 and 25000 as you can see in the chart (https://github.com/valentind97/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_goals.png)

## The data we had was alot but not alot of it was on plays. Possibly having more data could have helped better see trends with the kickstarter data. Also another helpful chart we couldve made for this project would have been a chart that compared the amount of backers in the months. this would allow us to see when there were more people supporting the play kickstarters. 

## WE can conclude that the best time to start a play kickstarter if louise wanted to would be in the month of May and also have a goal of 45000 dollars. This would give her a higher probability of reaching the goal intended based on the data we analyzed.
